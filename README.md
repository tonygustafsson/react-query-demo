# React Query demo

This is an example page using [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/).

The backend is a simple NextJS API that manipulates an array, so changes will be reflected to the frontend, but if you restart the development server, the array will be reset.

Examples includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

More work will be done on this project, so stay tuned!
